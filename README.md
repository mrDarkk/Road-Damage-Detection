# Road-Damage-Detection
Keeping roads in a good condition is vital to safe driving. To monitor the degradation of road conditions is one of the important component in transportation maintenance which is labor intensive and requires domain expertise. Automatic detection of road damage is an important task in transportation maintenance for driving safety assurance. The intensity of damage and complexity of the background, makes this process a challenging task. A deep-learning based methodology for damage detection is proposed in this project after being inspired by recent success on applying Deep- learning in Computer Sciences.
